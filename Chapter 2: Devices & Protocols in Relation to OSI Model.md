Definition: MAC address:  Media access control
==============================================

Transmission devices: PC, Router, Modem

Receiver devices: Hub, Switch

Sending through cable

MAC address
--------------

Each of network interface card has a globally unique MAC address
MAC address is only use in layer 2: datalink layer
MAC address is considered as physical address of the network interface 

IP address
----------

layer 3: network layer
IP address is logical address mapped to physical address

EUI -64 
-------

EUI 64 is another name of IPv6 Global unicast
Ipv6 is Ip version 6, is a much larger set of binary digit that we can use to create IP address
Global unicast address is the address that specific for a single network interface across the world

Switch
------

* allow us to connect our devices in the same subnet. If we have multiple computers with IP address of the same subnet in the room, we can connect them via switch.

* Layer 2:data link

Router
--------

Layer 3:Network

Hub
-----

the hub just takes all the data it receives and just sends it out everybody that connectd to it. So hub allow us to pass data all to multiples computer in our network but it isn;t smart. It doesn;t do anything like routing or connected to IP address
Layer 2: data link

Encryption devices
-------------------

Layer 6: presentation
Format data

Cable 
-----

physical devices
Layer 1: physical

*NIC: Network interface card
Layer 1: physical

*Bridge:
Layer 2: Data link
Provide point to point connectivity
