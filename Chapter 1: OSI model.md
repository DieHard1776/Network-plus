**packet**

a piece of information that forms part of message sent through a computer network

**DNS**

Domain Name System: DNS 

**Layers in OSI model**

Has 7 layers

layer 1 to 7: Please Do Not Throw Sausage  Pizza Away

Layer 1: Physical layer

Layer 2: Data link layer

Layer 3: Network Layer

Layer 4: Transport Layer

Layer 5: Session Layer

Layer 6: Presentation Layer

Layer 7: Application Layer

**Layer 1: Physical Layer**

include:

* Cables/ bits

* physical/ electrical

conversion between Data -> signal include:

1/ Pinout: pinout in our cable, pinout on pin that we plugged into computer

2/ voltages

3/ cable specification: 

3/ NIC: network interface card: physical port & physical card inside our computer

**Layer 2: Datalink Layer**

Access
Transfer from point to point
MAC address: unique
Package bits/data into frame

*Layer 3: Network Layer
IP address is logical address,  they;re not address hard-coded into interface network card.
All computer with network interface card has MAC address and IP address.

Computer A needs to send data packets. Data packets are broken down into physical mean: electrical impulse. Electrical impulse are going to be sent out in our network interface card over a cable

Computer A (with MAC address ) need to send information to computer B. Computer B is in different network, different subnet to computer A. Because we need to connect to a different network, we need to have a "layer 3" devices. So their need to be 2 router for each computer A and B, and a cable between them to connect.


*Layer 4:Transport Layer
Management/control the data
split our commucation into packet
Types:
TCP
UDP

*Layer 5: Session Layer
where we establish our connection, handshake with other computers
Traffic control
control connection between computer


*Layer 6: Presentation Layer
Format data:
encryption/decryption
layer 6 format the data for sending, and decrypted when received

*Layer 7: Application Layer
Enable apps to acces network
